<!-- a variable starts with a dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name. 
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.
a variable name must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.
Variables are case-sensitive, meaning $name and $Name are different variables.
cannot start with special characters or spaces.  -->
